    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      From a young age, I've been curious about technology and how they can improve lives. Because of this I've put in hundreds or even thousands of hours learning about computers, programming, and web development with the goal of working at a large tech company or maybe starting my own. I have taken classes like Web Development and Computer Programming and skipped two grades to further my education. These classes have all provided skills such as collaboration, problem solving and essential coding principles. As I continue to grow I hope to learn more by taking more courses and taking an internship to achieve my goals.
